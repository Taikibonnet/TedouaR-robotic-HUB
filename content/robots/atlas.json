  "details": "# Atlas: The Next Generation Humanoid Robot\n\nAtlas is one of the most advanced humanoid robots in the world, created by Boston Dynamics. Standing approximately 1.5 meters tall and weighing about 80 kg, Atlas represents a major leap forward in robotics technology.\n\n## Advanced Mobility\n\nWhat sets Atlas apart is its remarkable mobility and agility. The robot can navigate through complex terrains that would challenge traditional wheeled or tracked robots. It can walk, run, jump, perform backflips, and even parkour - activities that demonstrate human-like athletic abilities.\n\n## Sophisticated Control Systems\n\nAtlas uses a sophisticated control system that combines computer vision, depth sensing, and machine learning algorithms. This enables it to:\n\n* Process visual information in real-time\n* Plan movements through complex environments\n* Maintain balance even when pushed or when walking on uneven terrain\n* Adapt to unexpected changes in its surroundings\n\n## Research Platform\n\nWhile Atlas is not yet commercially available, it serves as a research platform for testing advanced robotics concepts. The technologies developed through Atlas have applications in areas ranging from disaster response to industrial automation.",
