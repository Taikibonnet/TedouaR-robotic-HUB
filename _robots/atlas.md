# Atlas - The Dynamic Humanoid

Atlas is a bipedal humanoid robot designed and built by Boston Dynamics. It stands approximately 1.5 meters (5 feet) tall, weighs around 89 kg (196 pounds), and is powered by hydraulics.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Mobility**: Atlas can navigate through challenging and uneven terrain using stereo vision, range sensing, and other sensors.
- **Dynamic Movements**: Can perform dynamic movements including running, jumping, backflips, and parkour-like maneuvers.
- **Dexterous Manipulation**: Equipped with hands capable of grasping and manipulating various objects.
- **Whole-Body Control**: Uses coordinated motion of limbs, torso, and hands for balance and manipulation tasks.
- **Advanced Perception**: Uses lidar and stereo vision to model its surroundings in 3D.

## Applications

Atlas was initially funded by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and was designed for search and rescue tasks. Its potential applications include:

1. Disaster response in environments too dangerous for humans
2. Research platform for advanced robotics and AI
3. Industrial applications requiring human-like mobility and dexterity

## Development History

Boston Dynamics has continuously improved Atlas since its first public appearance in 2013:

- **2013**: First generation Atlas revealed
- **2015**: New version shown at DARPA Robotics Challenge
- **2016**: Next generation (more compact) revealed
- **2018**: Parkour capabilities demonstrated
- **2020-2023**: Increasingly fluid and dynamic movements showcased

## Impact on Robotics

Atlas represents a significant milestone in humanoid robotics, demonstrating levels of agility, balance, and adaptability previously thought impossible. Its development has pushed the boundaries of what robots can physically accomplish and serves as inspiration for future humanoid designs.

Boston Dynamics continues to use Atlas primarily as a research platform, regularly publishing videos of its new capabilities that captivate global audiences.
